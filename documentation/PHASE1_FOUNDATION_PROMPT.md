# PHASE 1: Foundation & Architecture - World-Class SaaS Development

## Context & Mission
You are a senior full-stack architect specializing in enterprise SaaS applications. Your task is to design and implement the foundational architecture for a world-class event management platform that will compete with Eventbrite, Meetup, and Zoom Events.

**Development Environment**: Windows 11, PowerShell 5.1, React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Node.js
**Current Project**: Eventra (Event Management Platform)
**Phase Goal**: Create bulletproof foundation that can scale to millions of users

## Phase 1 Core Objectives

### 1. Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture
Design a robust multi-tenant system where each organization has:
- Complete data isolation and security
- Custom subdomain support (client.eventra.com)
- Tenant-specific configurations and branding
- Scalable database sharding strategies
- Resource allocation and usage tracking

### 2. Authentication & Authorization System
Implement enterprise-grade auth with:
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration (SAML, OAuth 2.0)
- Social login providers (Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn)
- Password policies and security compliance

### 3. Database Architecture
Design a scalable database system with:
- PostgreSQL for primary relational data
- Redis for sessions, caching, and real-time features
- Optimized schemas for multi-tenancy
- Database migrations and seeding strategies
- Connection pooling and query optimization
- Data backup and disaster recovery plans

### 4. API Design Excellence
Create RESTful APIs with:
- Consistent API standards and documentation
- Request/response validation with detailed error handling
- Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
- API versioning strategies
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- GraphQL integration for complex queries

### 5. Core Data Models
Define essential entities with proper relationships:
- **Organizations**: Tenant management, settings, branding
- **Users**: Profiles, roles, permissions, preferences
- **Events**: Comprehensive event data structure
- **Tickets**: Flexible ticketing system
- **Bookings**: Registration and attendance tracking
- **Payments**: Transaction history and billing

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Framework
- **Primary**: Node.js with Express.js or Fastify
- **Alternative**: Consider NestJS for enterprise patterns
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with comprehensive type definitions
- **Validation**: Joi or Zod for request/response validation
- **ORM**: Prisma or TypeORM for database operations

### Security Standards
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Headers**: Security headers (CORS, CSP, HSTS)
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS and SQL injection prevention
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking
- **Environment Variables**: Secure secret management

### Development Setup
- **Docker**: Containerized development environment
- **Database Seeding**: Sample data for all tenant scenarios
- **Environment Management**: Local, staging, production configs
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, pre-commit hooks
- **Testing**: Unit tests for all core functions

## Deliverables for Phase 1

```

### 2. Database Schema
Complete PostgreSQL schema with:
- Multi-tenant table design with tenant_id columns
- Proper indexes for performance optimization
- Foreign key relationships and constraints
- Audit trails for all critical operations
- Sample data for development and testing

### 3. Authentication System
Full implementation including:
- User registration and email verification
- Secure login with JWT tokens
- Password reset functionality
- Role and permission management
- Session handling and security
- Admin user management interface

### 4. API Endpoints
Core RESTful endpoints for:
```
POST   /api/auth/register
POST   /api/auth/login
POST   /api/auth/logout
GET    /api/auth/me
POST   /api/auth/refresh-token

GET    /api/organizations
POST   /api/organizations
PUT    /api/organizations/:id

GET    /api/users
POST   /api/users
PUT    /api/users/:id
DELETE /api/users/:id

GET    /api/events
POST   /api/events
PUT    /api/events/:id
DELETE /api/events/:id
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Multi-tenant system with complete data isolation
- [ ] Secure authentication with role-based permissions
- [ ] Scalable database schema supporting 10K+ organizations
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- [ ] 100% test coverage for core authentication flows
- [ ] Docker development environment working seamlessly
- [ ] Performance: <100ms response times for core endpoints
- [ ] Security: Passes OWASP security checklist

## Code Quality Standards
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with meaningful error messages
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all functions and complex logic
- **Type Safety**: No 'any' types, strict TypeScript configuration
- **Testing**: Unit tests for services, integration tests for APIs
