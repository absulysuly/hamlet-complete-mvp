## Critical Path Highlights
- **Tailwind Migration** (Week 1) → Required for stable builds and marketing captures.
- **.filter() Safeguards** (Week 1) → Prevent runtime crashes during demos/tests.
- **Women Badge & Localization Verification** (Week 1-2) → Essential for mission objectives.
- **Regression & Automation** (Week 2-3) → Ensures reliable platform performance before marketing push.
- **Launch Approval Sequence** (Week 4) → Director sign-off requires all documentation, QA, and backups complete.

## Daily Oversight Rhythm
- **09:00** – Agent updates consolidated in `status.md`.
- **12:00** – Backup verification ping logged in `backup-log.md`.
- **15:00** – QA interim check recorded in `qa-matrix.md`.
- **18:00** – Agent 6 commits daily summary and updates `daily-reports/`.
- **20:00** – Director reviews status, prepares notes, submits AI Studio requests if needed.

## Automation & Reporting Suggestions
- Script to detect required "Oversight Sync" commit messages and auto-populate Director Notes draft.
- Daily diff capture for `status.md` and `backup-log.md` to trace progress.
- Create shared dashboard (spreadsheet or markdown table) summarizing agent completion per week.
