## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### **Phase 1: UAE Expansion (Pilot)** - *2-3 weeks*

```javascript
// 1. Add UAE-specific translations
messages/
  ├── en.json (existing)
  ├── ar.json (existing) 
  ├── ku.json (existing)
  └── ar-AE.json (new - UAE Arabic)

// 2. UAE-specific cities data
const UAE_CITIES = [
  'Dubai', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Sharjah', 'Ajman', 
  'Ras Al Khaimah', 'Fujairah', 'Umm Al Quwain'
];

// 3. Currency and date formatting
const UAE_CONFIG = {
  currency: 'AED',
  dateFormat: 'DD/MM/YYYY',
  timeZone: 'Asia/Dubai',
  language: 'ar-AE'
};
```

#### Week 2: Database & Content Adaptation
```sql
-- Add country-specific content table
CREATE TABLE country_configs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  country_code VARCHAR(2),
  cities JSONB,
  currency VARCHAR(3),
  languages JSONB,
  features JSONB
);

-- UAE-specific event categories
INSERT INTO categories (country, name_en, name_ar) VALUES
('AE', 'Business Networking', 'شبكات الأعمال'),
('AE', 'Desert Adventures', 'مغامرات صحراوية'),
('AE', 'Luxury Events', 'فعاليات فاخرة');
```

#### Week 3: Testing & Launch

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **1. Country Configuration System**
```typescript
// src/lib/countries.ts
export const COUNTRY_CONFIGS = {
  IQ: {
    name: 'Iraq',
    code: 'IQ',
    currency: 'IQD',
    languages: ['ar', 'ku', 'en'],
    cities: ['Baghdad', 'Basra', 'Erbil', 'Sulaymaniyah'],
    features: ['whatsapp_integration', 'cash_payments']
  },
  AE: {
    name: 'UAE', 
    code: 'AE',
    currency: 'AED',
    languages: ['ar', 'en'],
    cities: ['Dubai', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Sharjah'],
    features: ['credit_cards', 'luxury_categories']
  }
};
```

### **2. Dynamic Routing System**
```typescript
// src/app/[country]/layout.tsx
export default function CountryLayout({ 
  children, 
  params: { country } 
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  params: { country: string };
}) {
  const config = COUNTRY_CONFIGS[country.toUpperCase()];
  return (
    <CountryProvider config={config}>
      {children}
    </CountryProvider>
  );
}
```

### **3. Localized Components**
```typescript
// Existing EventForm automatically adapts
const EventForm = () => {
  const { country } = useCountry();
  const cities = COUNTRY_CONFIGS[country].cities;
  const currency = COUNTRY_CONFIGS[country].currency;
  
  // Component automatically uses country-specific data
  return (
    <form>
      <CitySelector cities={cities} />
      <PriceInput currency={currency} />
    </form>
  );
};
```
